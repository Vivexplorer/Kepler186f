        <h2>Key Facts about Kepler-186f:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Discovered: April 17, 2014</li>
            <li>Orbiting Star: Kepler-186</li>
            <li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 582 light-years</li>
            <li>Size: Similar to Earth</li>
            <li>Potential Habitability: Kepler-186f is located in the habitable zone of its star, where conditions might be suitable for liquid water to exist.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Discovery of Kepler-186f:</h2>
        <p>Kepler-186f was discovered by the Kepler spacecraft, which observed the subtle dimming of the star's light as the exoplanet passed in front of it. This method, known as the transit method, is commonly used to detect exoplanets.</p>

        <h2>Significance of Kepler-186f:</h2>
        <p>Kepler-186f is significant because it is one of the first Earth-sized exoplanets discovered within the habitable zone of its star. While its atmosphere and surface conditions are still unknown, its discovery fuels the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life and expands our understanding of the universe.</p>
